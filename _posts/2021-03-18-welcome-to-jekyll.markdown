We went live today with the aid of `jekyll` which we don't know much about yet. Seems quite interesting.
Initially I wanted to build the page with html and css from scratch but I figured how daunting it would be 
as I haven't used them in a long time and I don't know exactly how dynamic is but what I do know for sure is
I don't like copying the same lines of code on multiple pages and maintaining it and so here we are!

Leaving this here for future use

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
